c39f3734-460f-3df0-b44c-4ac4110d690c;AAPL;Epic Games Valuation May Hit $28 Billion in Latest Round: Sky;(Bloomberg) -- Epic Games could be worth about $28 billion based on its latest round of fundraising, Sky News reported, propelling the company into the ranks of the world’s 10 most valuable startups.The owner of the popular game Fortnite is finalizing terms for a $1 billion funding round, Sky said, citing people familiar it didn’t identify. At that valuation, Epic would overtake startups including Rivian Automotive Inc., based on data compiled by CB Insights.The latest raise came just seven months after Epic closed a round of capital from investors including Sony Corp. and Baillie Gifford at a valuation of $17.3 billion. It recently expanded its portfolio with the purchase of the maker of “Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,” an online game that was one of the breakout hits of the pandemic.Bank of America Corp. is advising Epic Games on the latest transaction, Sky said. Epic declined to comment to Sky and didn’t immediately respond to an email from Bloomberg.Multiple startups have seen their valuations surge amid the pandemic. Stripe Inc.’s valuation almost tripled in less than a year to $95 billion with its latest funding round, making it the most valuable U.S. startup. The online payments processing company raised $600 million in its round, Stripe said on March 14.Rivian, an electric-vehicle startup backed by Amazon.com Inc. and Ford Motor Co., may also be valued higher in an initial public offering later this year. It’s looking to go public as soon as September at a valuation of at least $50 billion, versus $27.6 billion in a funding round in January, people familiar said last month.Epic is also not backing off from taking on giant technology companies. It’s nearing a trial after it sued Apple Inc. over the removal of Fortnite from the App Store. Its Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney and Apple chief Tim Cook may testify at the trial, according to a court document.Apple’s Cook, Other Executives to Testify in Fortnite TrialFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Sat, 20 Mar 2021 19:23:56 +0000;AAPL_2021-03-20;0.9691;0.0

941fe78b-f324-377b-840f-e96dbf4aca97;AAPL;Apple Ordered To Pay $308.5 Million In Patent Infringement Case;Apple could have to pay $308.5 million for infringing a digital rights management patent. What Happened: A federal jury in Marshall, Texas, on Friday ruled that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) infringed a patent related to Personalized Media Communications LLC’s (PMC) digital rights management, and said Apple must pay $308.5 million to PMC, Reuters has reported. The jurors also asked Apple to pay a running royalty to PMC. Sugarland, Texas-based PMC says Apple owes $240 million in royalties. According to Reuters, Apple is dissatisfied with the verdict and will appeal. “Cases like this, brought by companies that don’t make or sell any products, stifle innovation and ultimately harm consumers,” Apple said. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock Why It Matters: PMC sued Apple in 2015, alleging that its iTunes service infringed seven of its patents. Apple challenged the case at the patent office, and in 2020 an appeals court reversed the decision.

1a4d5f08-8f3e-3849-b712-ba28bc466237;AAPL;Corporate America Primed to Join Warren Buffett in Buyback Binge;"(Bloomberg) -- The recent rise in interest rates may be causing nervousness among some investors, but it’s unlikely to prevent a buying binge among the biggest whales in the stock market: Corporations themselves.U.S. companies’ swollen cash piles and a rosy outlook for earnings are raising expectations that more executives will follow in the footsteps of Warren Buffett and unleash a spree of share repurchases, adding a layer of support to the stock market after buybacks plummeted last year. At the very least, the purchases could help offset a surge in supply of shares this year by a parade of special acquisition companies going public and a record number of secondary offerings.“When you see cash flow accelerate, you see buybacks follow shortly thereafter,” said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. “There’s a tremendous amount of cash sitting out there with nowhere to go.”S&amp;P 500 companies entered this quarter with more than $2.2 trillion in cash and Wall Street is projecting 24% earnings growth in 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Repurchases among companies in the benchmark index have already shown signs of rebounding. Buybacks rose to $120 billion in the last three months of 2020, up 28% from the previous quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the first time since the Covid-19 crisis, more than half of the index bought back shares. Still, buyback activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels of $197.7 billion recorded in the first three months of 2020.Should buybacks return to average levels over the five years prior to 2020, repurchases would expand by nearly 50% in 2021, according to Adams. In a survey conducted by RBC Capital in mid-March, about 60% of analysts said buybacks are a priority for management teams looking to deploy cash. Only dividends received a higher score of 76%, the bank’s head of U.S. equity strategy, Lori Calvasina, said in a note to clients.“U.S. equities will be strong in 2021, supported by a recovery in buybacks, solid dividends, a recovery in margins, and strong economic fundamental support,” she wrote, while also noting that expensive valuations will probably limit gains.Muted EffectNot everyone is bullish on the buyback effect. While repurchase activity is poised to increase this year, it’s unlikely to reach levels seen before the pandemic thanks to high price-to-earnings multiples and waning investor enthusiasm for buybacks, according to Bank of America Corp. equities strategist Jill Carey Hall. Rising corporate buying will also be muted by a boom in companies raising money by selling shares, Hall said in an interview.The bank’s corporate clients repurchased $3.7 billion of shares last week, the second highest total on record, Hall and her colleague Savita Subramanian wrote in a research note. The buying has been led by technology companies but sectors like health care, consumer discretionary and financials have accelerated purchases.Technology companies, many of which saw business boom over the past year, have remained steadfast in their buying relative to other industries. Tech accounted for 44% of total buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 in the fourth quarter, up from 27% in the same period a year ago. Sectors that drastically cut buyback activity, such as consumer discretionary and industrials, are poised to snap up more shares as earnings improve, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Adams said.Top BuyerThe biggest buyer by far has been Apple Inc. The technology giant bought back $24.8 billion of shares last quarter, more than the next four biggest buyers combined, according to Bloomberg data. The iPhone maker could set the tone next month when it typically updates investors on its capital return plans in conjunction with fiscal second-quarter earnings.Of course, some investors frown upon companies putting cash to work buying their own shares rather than investing in things like acquisitions or research and development. However, even Buffett is a fan these days. The Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chief, who in the past has been critical of buybacks himself, spent more than $24.7 billion of his company’s cash on repurchases in 2020 and praised Apple’s buying for increasing Berkshire’s stake in the company.Berkshire Hathaway has continued to snap up its own shares in 2021 and is likely to buy more, the billionaire investor wrote in his annual shareholder letter last month.“The process offers a simple way for investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses,” Buffett said before quoting Mae West: “Too much of a good thing can be ... wonderful.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.";Sat, 20 Mar 2021 11:30:00 +0000;AAPL_2021-03-20;0.9987;0.296

9b5fd501-5601-37da-b8a8-fe5093d4cc90;MSFT;Microsoft Adds New Vaccine Management Tools To Amend Past Loopholes: Bloomberg;Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) launched a new technology to drive government and health care organizations’ vaccine management systems to fix the company’s initial custom-built program deficiencies, Bloomberg reports. The Microsoft Vaccine Management product features and new apps aim to improve and fix the glitches during the Vaccination Registration and Application System in New Jersey and Washington D.C. It used health care standards for quicker data export to electronic medical records. The software also addressed other issues, including user pre-registration before the COVID-19 vaccine appointment and proactive handling of demand spikes. Salesforce.Com Inc (NYSE: CRM) tried to exploit the opportunity by providing a free replacement for Microsoft vaccine cloud software based on their tweet to government officials. Last month, Microsoft faced three consecutive days of problems with the District of Columbia’s online vaccination registration due to a demand spike leading to a public uproar. The vaccine registration resumed on a smoother note from the following week after Microsoft’s admittance of its shortcomings and assurance towards a resolution. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy criticized significant glitches in the state’s Microsoft-built vaccination scheduling system. Iowa backed out of Microsoft’s contract within a week of its announcement. Price action: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.36% at $231.55 on the last check Friday.

fc7ba4d2-105d-3dfa-9d50-22ef12f9c3e8;MSFT;Microsoft Unveils New Vaccine Tools to Address Earlier Failures;(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. unveiled new technology to boost government and health care organizations’ vaccine management systems, including scheduling shot appointments and monitoring results, to fix shortcomings weeks after the company’s initial custom-built programs ran aground in a few states.The Microsoft Vaccine Management product released Friday is made up of features and new apps that the software company said will improve upon and fix the glitches that occurred when its previous effort, the Vaccination Registration and Application System, failed to work properly in New Jersey and Washington D.C. The new software “incorporates lessons learned from VRAS regarding scalable architecture, improved user experiences for residents and health care workers,” the company said in an email. It also uses health care standards for information transfer so data can be exported more quickly to other record systems, such as electronic medical records. The software also addresses other issues that hampered the previous option, including requiring users to pre-register before seeking a Covid-19 vaccine appointment and providing a way to proactively handle spikes in demand. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has put considerable effort over the past few years to building and promoting cloud-computing tools for health care providers, as well as selling its ability to manage complex systems that combine older programs and data sources with newer internet-based apps and information. That meant complaints about its initial custom-built vaccine management systems from high-profile politicians and unhappy patients stung. Rival Marc Benioff, chief executive officer of cloud software company Salesforce.com Inc., tried to use Microsoft’s issues to his advantage, tweeting at government officials last month that he’d be happy to replace the Microsoft vaccine cloud software for free with his company’s product. Last month, Microsoft faced three straight days of problems with the District of Columbia’s online vaccination registration as demand for the system far exceeded the ability to handle it. The outcry from frustrated residents led the company to release a statement along with the city government acknowledging “that our efforts have fallen short” and vowing to address the problems. Vaccine registration the following week went more smoothly.In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy complained about significant glitches in the state’s Microsoft-built vaccination scheduling system, which was marred by issues for weeks after it was rolled out, though that system has also since been fixed. Iowa had announced it would use Microsoft for its vaccination system, but backed out of the contract a week later.

0efd6bba-8d9b-37ad-91be-082fda8bcbe6;MSFT;NSA, Homeland Security Push Service to Mitigate Cyber-Attacks;(Bloomberg) -- As the U.S. reels from major cyber-attacks by suspected Russian and Chinese hackers, officials are looking to implement new technologies that would allow the federal government to respond more effectively.The National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security believe they have part of the answer within the Domain Name System, or DNS, often referred to as the phone book of the internet. They are encouraging government agencies and high-risk companies to embrace a system known as Protective DNS, in which a private security firm would monitor and filter web traffic.The payoff could be enormous, officials say. PDNS blocked connections to malicious websites millions of times in a recent test involving five U.S. defense contractors. After it was installed in the U.K., the system blocked nearly 60 million connections to suspect sites in 2018 alone, including 450,000 related to the infamous WannaCry strain of ransomware, according to a report issued by the National Cyber Security Centre.DNS is “often a problem for agencies that we protect,” said Cameron Dixon, a policy technologist at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security. That is because, while DNS is a basic component of the internet, it is often overlooked by network defenders, Dixon said.Protecting DNS would allow the U.S. to “take more swift and comprehensive action quite immediately” in the aftermath of major cyber-attacks, such as the two recent breaches, said Lieutenant Zachary Dannelly, a deputy chief operations officer at the National Security Agency.The NSA and the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance recommending PDNS the same week Microsoft Corp. revealed that suspected Chinese hackers had compromised users through flaws in its code for Microsoft Exchange, the company’s software for email. The attack affected tens of thousands of users, according to cybersecurity experts.Months earlier, cybersecurity investigators revealed that suspected hackers had exploited a vulnerability in software by the Texas-based firm SolarWinds Corp., which is used across the government and private sector. At least nine U.S. agencies and 100 companies were targeted by the suspected Russian hackers. The twin attacks created a sense that efforts to secure the internet, despite years of multi-billion dollar investments and technology advances, had simply broken down. PDNS only works in cases of known malware, meaning it wouldn’t have been able to block the attacks on SolarWinds and Microsoft. But it would have aided the response to both attacks, according to the officials.The PDNS service recommended by the U.S. government has two major benefits in the face of cyber-attacks, the officials said. First, it scans DNS queries to identify requests to access web addresses that are associated with known malware and blocks them, stopping users from going to malicious sites such as when they inadvertently click on links sent in phishing emails.The second benefit is that it tracks DNS queries and maintains a log. This log is valuable when new malware is discovered because the tracked information can provide a road map to where the malicious code has landed -- the information needed to “facilitate strong incident response activities,” said Dixon.The U.S. government and private sector have struggled to respond to the recent Microsoft and SolarWinds attacks because of their size and complexity. For example, a senior administration official said Friday that the nine agencies breached in the SolarWinds attack will complete their network reviews by the end of March -- almost four months after the suspected Russian hackers were first discovered.The U.S. decision to recommend PDNS is the result of a study conducted by the Department of Defense and NSA. Over six months, starting in March 2020, Defense officials added protections to DNS on computer systems of five different companies in the defense sector.Then, the officials monitored the DNS queries -- or requests to translate domain names entered by people into IP addresses that are usable by computers -- that took place within the company networks during that period. The officials studied how many hacking attempts they could catch using PDNS protections.The study was highly successful, said Dannelly. Of the 4 billion DNS queries made in the course of the six months at the companies under observation, PDNS flagged 3,500 malicious domains and blocked suspicious connections 13 million times. In addition, his team was able to use information generated by PDNS logs to find two malicious devices connected to the company networks -- an internet-connected light switch and an employee’s personal device that contained malware.In 2017, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre released similar guidance. While the U.K. government built a PDNS service for use by the public sector, the American effort relies on private-sector security companies to provide the protection. The U.S. guidance is largely aimed at operators of critical infrastructure and national security systems in the public and private sector.The NSA chose to study PDNS because it is low-cost and scalable, according to Dannelly. It’s one of the security elements needed to protect the U.S. from cyber-attacks moving forward, he said, adding that U.S. is considering similar studies on other cybersecurity techniques.“It is not the silver bullet,” Dixon said. “It is a piece of a layered approach. You need to have more pieces than just this.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Thu, 18 Mar 2021 13:59:11 +0000;MSFT_2021-03-18;0.9693;0.34

Another media company probably benefited from the interview, as well. What Happened: Viewership for “The Crown,” a series about the British royal family, rose around the airing of the interview. Variety reports that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) saw viewership for “The Crown” peak on March 1, the day after the show won several Golden Globes and highlights of the interview were released. Viewership also spiked for “The Crown” the day the interview aired on ViacomCBS Inc's (NASDAQ: VIAC) CBS network. Nielsen reports more than 21 million viewers in the U.S. watched the interview. Average viewership was double the normal amount in many of the days surrounding the interview, according to data from ReelGood.

Netflix doesn’t release regular viewership metrics, but did say in January the show has been watched by over 100 million viewers since its launch. Season 4 of “The Crown” was watched by more viewers in the first 28 days than any of the other three seasons, according to the company. At the 78th Annual Golden Globes on Feb. 4, the show won Best Drama, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress.

Prince Harry did say on “The Late Late Show with James Corden"": “It gives you a rough idea about what lifestyle is, the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.” While Prince Harry said the ""The Crown"" is not accurate, he also offered up this during the Corden interview: “I’m way more comfortable with ‘The Crown’ that I am seeing the stories written about my family, my wife or myself.” Two more seasons of “The Crown” are set to be released on Netflix. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle previously signed a deal for content on Netflix. Netflix passed the 200 million subscriber mark in 2020. Price Action: Netflix shares are up 1% to $507.49 on Friday.

61db5040-6567-3772-b5a8-47d37920e2e4;AAPL;4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, AAPL, NNOX, V;After a very bumpy week and quadruple witching expiration day on Friday, let’s look ahead to next week with some top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Boeing (BA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider What a beautiful setup we have in Boeing (NYSE:BA). I love when a stock rips higher to upside, giving us a weekly-up and/or monthly-up rotation, just as Boeing did last week. Shares went on to scream higher, topping out near $278.57 before resetting. These resets are where bulls can look for more continuation. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This nice little bull flag consolidation just tagged the 10-day moving average before bouncing on Friday. Aggressive buyers would have bought on today’s dip. More conservative traders will wait for a rotation over Friday’s high. Either way, a close below the 10-day moving average and the 61.8% retracement likely saps more momentum from the stock in the short term. If we get a rotation over Friday’s high though, this stock could be heading back to $275-plus. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Apple (AAPL) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has not shown the leadership that investors wish it would — it’s been that way for a few quarters now. The stock briefly broke out over the $138 level in January, only to lose that mark after reporting earnings (despite those earnings being really good). The stock has gone on to lose a number of key moving averages, as well as the $126 level. Notice the way the 100-day moving average went from support to resistance, most recently rejecting Apple earlier this week. So what now? Bulls need to see Apple either retest the recent low or they need to see a rotation. If it’s a rotation, I’d love to see shares clear $127.22 next week. Not only would that give us a weekly-up rotation, but it would also put shares over the key $126.75 level, as well as the 10-day, 21-day and 100-day moving averages. It would at least give bulls some type of momentum. If lower prices are in order, see how Apple handles last week’s low at $116.21 and the 200-day moving average. Below could put the November low in play near $112.50. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Visa (V) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider For years, Visa (NYSE:V) was a steady winner, grinding higher and higher as secular trends continued to propel its growth. However, the stock has been a bit choppier over the past year, as global consumption has waxed and waned. On Friday, Visa took a hit, falling back below $217.35. Into a few key moving averages now, let’s see how the stock responds. Do the 50-day and 100-day moving averages combine to support Visa and give it a bounce back over $217.50? Or are lower prices in store? If it’s the former, let’s see if it can also reclaim the 10-day and 21-day moving averages. If it’s the latter, I’d love to see a decline into the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Below these measures puts the key 21-month moving average on deck, a level I like when it comes to the credit card companies. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Nano-X Imaging (NNOX) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider We don’t talk about Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ:NNOX) too much, but it’s become more of a talking point over the last month or two. After back-to-back inside days, the stock is getting coiled up pretty tight. While holding its 10-day and 21-day moving averages, shares are struggling to push through the 100-day moving average. It also has a wide weekly range. On the plus side, we can use that range for added direction. Above the weekly high at $52.60, gives bulls a potential weekly-up rotation and puts NNOX over the 100-day moving average. That could put the 50-day moving average in play, followed a potential rally into the $60s. On the downside, a break of this week’s low at $44.22 could put the $40 to $42 zone on the table. Below that and the March low is possible all the way down at $32.20. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NNOX.

313d66d4-474a-31a6-b180-d8bdbad6e71e;AAPL;7 Tech Stocks Still Quenching Our Thirst for Smartphones;To say that consumers have adopted the smartphone would be an understatement: in 2020 about 1.38 billion smartphones were sold worldwide. In the U.S. alone there are more than 260 million smartphone users. That figure indicates that penetration rates have eclipsed 80% in the U.S. And there is plenty of money being made by tech stocks when counted as revenue from smartphone sales. In fact, annual sales now exceed $70 billion. Those figures leave investors extremely curious about the potential of stocks within the sector. Indeed, investors can view the sector from several angles. This article will primarily look at the companies behind the physical product consumers receive, i.e., the actual smartphone itself. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing What follows is a list of seven strong companies to consider investing in as our collective demand for smartphones shows few signs of waning. They are:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (NYSE:TSM) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Ericsson (NYSE:ERIC) Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) MagnaChip Semiconductor (NYSE:MX) Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Tech Stocks: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. is a company any investor interested in semiconductors and smartphones should know about. The company is integral to both of those industries. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that TSMC is a company everyone should know about. That’s because it is the world’s leading semiconductor foundry. A foundry is simply a manufacturer which supplies semiconductors to companies that outsource their designed chips. And semiconductors are in everything. TSMC manufactured 10,761 products for 499 customers in 2019. But I digress. TSMC manufactures 5nm chips which are becoming increasingly important. Revenues for 5 nm chips have taken off in the past two quarters. TSMC manufactures the Apple A14 Bionic. That chip is used in the iPhone 12 and the iPad Air 2020. And TSMC has recently become even more important as there is an ongoing semiconductor shortage. As a result, TSMC is in an extremely strong position. TSMC’s monthly revenues are rising quickly. In January the company saw revenue rise 22.2% year-over-year. And in February revenue increased by 14.1% YoY. As far as plays on smartphones go, TSM stock is a very smart bet. Apple (AAPL) Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com It’s only right to write about Apple when discussing demand for smartphones. According to livemint.com, Apple makes 5 out of the 10 most sold phones of 2020. Although Apple is clearly a strong company, it is in a bit of a strange place. Apple had a huge first quarter. Back in late January the company posted record quarterly earnings. Revenues hit an all-time high of $111.4 billion and earnings were $1.68 per share representing a 35% increase. But AAPL stock is down nevertheless. In fact, Apple shares have lost about 16% of their value since late January. There is a general sentiment that perhaps Apple had run out of steam. After all, how can it beat its incredible Q1 results? Further, Apple didn’t provide clear revenue guidance for the coming quarter citing the pandemic as the reason. The situation represents an obvious buy-the-dip opportunity. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing As an investor I’d ask myself this question: is Apple likely to continue to grow, or not? I side with more bullish opinions about Apple as a current buy-the-dip target. Among those voices are Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy, who stated “We think the Street still underappreciates Apple’s opportunity with 5G, in our view, there’s much more to come as we’re only in the initial innings of Apple’s 5G adoption cycle.” Ericsson (ERIC) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Let’s switch gears from chips and smartphone manufacturers to another massive narrative in smartphones: 5G. Specifically, let’s look at the buildout of the 5G networks. That’s where Ericsson figures prominently in relation to the conversation around smartphone demand. Ericsson is currently engaged in a pitched battle with Huawei and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) to establish commercial agreements with 5G operators across the globe. Back in August of 2020, Ericsson announced it had secured its 100th 5G commercial agreement with unique service providers. At that time it also operated 56 live global networks. Huawei is leading the race to secure network contracts but it faces pressure from governments around the globe. Governments worry the Chinese company will use its 5G equipment to spy on other countries. The U.S. Department of Justice case against Huawei has cast light upon the Chinese company and global governments are clearly worried as well. As a result, Huawei is now banned from several countries. This opened the door for Ericsson and Nokia. Ericsson’s most recent count is 131 5G commercial contracts and 79 live networks. Nokia, on the other hand, has 146 commercial 5G deals and 55 live networks. Huawei is far and away the leader though. It has signed more than 1,000 corporate 5G contracts. All three of these companies sit within Gartner’s Magic Quadrant, which highlights leaders within specific industries. So why consider Ericsson over Huawei or Nokia? The answer to that question is simple: Ericsson is much better regarded on Wall Street and Huawei isn’t a publicly traded company. Tech Stocks: Micron Technology (MU) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Micron Technology is another semiconductor manufacturer on this list. The company’s solutions span multiple industries including 5G and Mobile. Micron, like most smartphone chip manufacturers, focuses on efficient chips which minimize power consumption while enabling high-speed data. It has a few interesting projects for mobile as an end market. Micron is addressing the high-end mobile market with its 176 layer NAND. 176 layer NAND features 2X more efficiency than its previous 96 layer NAND as well as doubled write performance. This means that Micron’s chips have utility in smartphones which require better specs to power their operation. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing Q1 mobile revenue was up YoY for Micron.

MagnaChip also provides multiple mobile power solutions for smartphones. MagnaChip reported Q4 revenues of $142.9 million, which represented a 15.9% YoY increase. OLED DDIC revenue amounted to $80.4 million of that $142.9 million during the quarter. The $80.4 million OLED DDICs was a new quarterly record, and an increase of 19.4% YoY. OLED DDIC displays provide 1440 X 3360 resolution and MagnaChip is entering full scale production after the encouraging results. The displays will be integrated into 5G phones.

Qorvo (QRVO) Source: Shutterstock Qorvo is yet another semiconductor company which has seen a fair amount of success lately. The company has recorded EPS earnings beats in each of the past four quarters. That said, it isn’t an outright “buy” according to Wall Street. Instead, it maintains an “overweight” status based on the opinions of the analysts covering the stock. Qorvo saw both revenues and profits rise during the last three quarters of 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Revenues increased by 20.44%, while net income increased by 54.57%. That indicates that Qorvo is operationally efficient. And increased sales translate to an even larger increase in net income. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing Qorvo is a supplier to Apple. According to a recent Barron’s article, Qorvo may be more important than ever. Qorvo makes RF (radio frequency) chips that help phones connect to wireless networks and the internet. A Barclay’s analyst recently disregarded indications that the iPhone mini may see a 20% reduction in orders. The analyst issued a note countering that notion, and as a result Qorvo shares rose.

Qualcomm is separated into three distinct business segments including QCT (CDMA technologies), QTL (technology licensing), and QSI (strategic initiatives). The QCT sector accounts for roughly 3X the revenues of the QTL sector while QSI is an outlay of capital for investment initiatives.

c39ffa6a-48e4-3ede-8124-ebaa13b18bb0;ADBE;Swiss Hacker’s Indictment Spotlights Ethics of Activist Attacks;(Bloomberg) -- The indictment of a 21-year-old Swiss hacker who claimed credit for exposing the flaws in a surveillance camera company’s system is likely to stir debate about whether attacks by activists for social or political causes are criminal behavior.Tillie Kottmann, who uses they/them pronouns, was indicted Thursday in Seattle and charged with crimes including wire fraud and identity theft. Kottmann made headlines last week when they claimed credit for gaining access to the 150,000 security cameras sold by San Mateo, California-based Verkada Inc. While the charges don’t involve the Verkada incident, Kottmann previously said they hacked Nissan Motor Co., and leaked documents from chipmaker Intel Corp.Kottmann, in a previous interview, said their hacking is inspired by an anti-intellectual property and anti-capitalist world view. For decades, underground hackers have pushed the limits of the law under the banner of “hacktivism,” pursuing a variety of leftist and anti-authoritarian ideals. In some cases, the U.S. government has been overly aggressive in their prosecution of those hackers, said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who has extensively researched hacker culture.“The hammer went down on hackers so heavily from the ’80s to the present, so the hacker community has this in mind,” Coleman said, adding she expects Kottmann to garner even more support in hacker circles following the indictment.Coleman said the Verkada break-in may be viewed differently than the hacks included in the indictment because Kottmann spoke to a journalist to publicly expose the video cameras’ flaws.“Some people would see that they did something in the public interest, and some of the escapades from prior were sort of useful hacking escapades,” Coleman said. “A lot of security researchers working for big name companies can identify with that, because their past was also about exploring these systems, and messing around, and sometimes messing up, as well.”Prosecutors in Seattle, however, sharply rebuked the view that the hacks had any redeeming quality.“Stealing credentials and data, and publishing source code and proprietary and sensitive information on the web is not protected speech -- it is theft and fraud,” Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman said in a statement announcing Kottmann’s indictment. “Wrapping oneself in an allegedly altruistic motive does not remove the criminal stench from such intrusion, theft, and fraud.”The U.S. accused Kottmann of hacking dozens of companies and government agencies, and said Kottmann operated a website, called “git.rip,” that published the internal documents and source code of more than 100 entities. The named victims include the state of Washington and the Washington Department of Transportation, as well as a microchip processor or manufacturer and a maker of tactical equipment.According to an archive of the “git.rip,” website, it included leaks from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Toyota Motor Corp., Adobe Inc., General Electric Co., GitHub and more. The site now displays a message stating it has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Scott Nawrocki, a 21-year FBI veteran who investigated cybercases, said the charges against Kottmann are serious whatever the motivations.“These kinds of individuals have to be held responsible,” said Nawrocki, now managing director of digital investigations and cyber defense at investigations firm Nardello & Co.. “Regardless of ideology, this is not white-hat hacking,” describing those who report computer bugs to companies so they can be fixed. “This is potentially inviting others to conduct hacking operations. To me, that’s criminal activity.”Nawrocki said there probably would be efforts to extradite Kottmann, and the indictment could limit Kottmann’s travel outside Switzerland because U.S. allies would arrest them.Swiss lawyer Roman Kost said it’s unlikely Kottmann will be sent to face criminal charges in the U.S., citing Swiss law that allows its citizens not to be extradited without their consent, but they may be punished inside Switzerland.Swiss hackers “can be tried in Switzerland if there is sufficient suspicion and evidence, and if they are found guilty, they can be punished,” Kost said in an email.Prosecutors allege that Kottmann sold hacking inspired merchandise, and that they sought contact from journalists in order to promote their data leaks and themselves. Kottman’s T-shirts included the phrases: “venture anticapitalist,” “no gender, only crime,” and “I would never do cybercrime.”Kottmann, citing the advice of their lawyer, declined to comment on the indictment. Swiss lawyer Marcel Bosonnet confirmed he represents Kottmann, but declined to comment further. The Justice Department also declined to comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 19 Mar 2021 21:18:42 +0000;ADBE_2021-03-19;0.512;-0.4404

63d4c2cc-f550-392d-aac9-0cb322bba2a0;ADBE;Why I Sold Adobe Stock;When you see an upward trajectory on a stock like Adobe Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), the natural tendency might be to hang on to this high-quality stock for a while longer. Just take a look at the chart below … InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Adobe is widely known for its software offerings, especially its Acrobat Pro software for creating, editing and sending PDF documents. However, there is much more to this company than just PDFs. Adobe Systems has three business segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. Digital Media encompasses all of Adobe Systems’ popular software, including Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver and Acrobat Pro. I first added Adobe Systems to my Growth Investor Buy List back in May 2018, ahead of the company’s second-quarter earnings announcement. At that time, Adobe Systems had double-digit forecasted earnings and sales growth. Over the past three years, the company has not disappointed: It has posted double-digit earnings growth and 10-straight quarterly earnings surprises. For its fourth quarter in fiscal year 2020, Adobe Systems reported 14% year-over-year revenue growth and 22.7% year-over-year earnings growth. Fourth-quarter earnings of $2.81 per share topped analysts’ estimates for $2.66 per share. The company still has solid forecasted earnings and sales growth. For the first quarter, the analyst community is looking for 22.5% year-over-year earnings growth and 21.6% year-over-year sales growth. So it may surprise you that I recommended my Growth Investor subscribers sell the stock yesterday for a roughly 99% gain. Why would I recommend selling a stock that looks like it will continue to post such a strong top and bottom line? The answer goes back to my focus on superior fundamentals. I study data on almost 5,000 stocks every week, focusing on eight “fundamentals.” These various measures of a stock, when taken collectively, can accurately tell you whether a company is doing well. Here are the eight factors I study when selecting my fundamentally superior stocks: Positive Earnings Revisions. I like to see stocks that have had their earnings estimates increased by Wall Street analysts. This usually tips us off to a stock that’s about to “beat earnings.” Positive Earnings Surprises. Speaking of beating earnings, I also look to see if a stock has been able to beat its earnings estimates, and by how much. This is an important number to watch, because it often tells me about a stock that Wall Street isn’t paying much attention to or doesn’t yet “get.” Increasing Sales. I also like to see a company that can consistently grow its sales over time. Why? Because it’s one number that is hard to fake. My background is in accounting, and I’ve always made sure to steer away from companies that use questionable accounting practices. Sales growth is a solid indicator. Expanding Operating Margins. This simply tells me if earnings are growing faster than sales. A company that’s able to expand its operating margins is usually a company that has a dominant position — such as a monopoly — in its industry. This company can raise prices without seeing a drop-off in sales. And that’s a nice place to be. Free Cash Flow. This tells me how much money a company has left over after paying the costs of its business. A strong cash flow is important because it allows a company to invest more resources in growing its business. Earnings Growth. This is the heart of all good financial analysis. As long as any company is able to grow its earnings consistently, its stock will do well. Positive Earnings Momentum. It’s not enough to see a company’s earnings grow — I also want to see it growing rapidly. Return on Equity, or ROE. This is the gold standard. ROE tells me how efficiently a company is managing its resources. I can’t interview every senior manager at a company, so I like to think of ROE as a report card for management. To get a good sense of how any individual stock is doing with regard to the fundamental factors I track, you can use my Portfolio Grader. And here’s what the latest report looks like for Adobe … As you can see, the stock has a Fundamental Grade of “B,” as well as solid Sales and Earnings Growth scores of “B,” and “A,” respectively. But I’m concerned with the overall drop off institutional buying pressure, as evidenced by its “D” Quantitative rating and overall D-rating in Portfolio Grader. The Quantitative Grade rating measures the buying pressure underneath a stock. If a stock receives an A- or B-rating, there is strong buying pressure supporting the stock. And the more relentless the buying pressure, the safer the stock. The reality is that persistent buying pressure reduces volatility. You can think of buying pressure as “following the money.” It signals that money is flooding into a stock and creating more momentum under a stock. So, buying pressure is vital to a stock’s success. Adobe has also seen a significant drop off in institutional buying pressure and its Quantitative Grade slipped to a D-rating over the weekend. It’s why I recommended my subscribers take advantage of yesterday’s market strength to book a high double-digit gain. The reality is buying pressure has started to ebb in some big flagship stocks and a leadership change is now underway in the stock market. As a result, the “Alpha” that I calculate in Portfolio Grader is starting to diminish and Quantitative Grades are falling — and that has led me to exit perfectly good, high-quality stocks in recent weeks. The bottom line is that I let the numbers decide when I choose to buy or sell a stock, not emotions or nostalgia or hope for ongoing performance. Investors who let emotions be their guide can end up holding stocks that will only fail them in the long term. Just because you love a stock doesn’t mean it loves you back.

What Went Wrong? The issues seem to have started around 1 p.m. EDT when users trying to send messages via WhatsApp and Messenger found their communications efforts being stymied. The Instagram app was unable to display new posts, with error messages popping up instead. According to a report on The Verge, there were more than 119,000 users reporting issues with Instagram on the DownDetector website that monitors online disruptions, while more than 25,000 users reported issues with WhatsApp and more than 5,000 had difficulties with Facebook Messenger. The Facebook site itself appears to have been spared from the problems. The issues were resolved at around 2:45 p.m. according to Facebook's platform status page. What Happens Now? Facebook acknowledged the problem on the Twitter page for Facebook Gaming. ""There are a number of issues currently affecting Facebook products, including gaming streams,"" said the tweet. ""Multiple teams are working on it, and we'll update you when we can."" In the interim, however, users on Twitter flooded that site with quickie memes that poked fun at Mark Zuckerberg’s problem-plagued digital empire.

3d56b61c-b1ab-39a4-a00c-b344c7badfd5;FB;Facebook Shares Gain Friday: Technical Levels To Watch;Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) shares were trading higher Friday. The stock is trending on StockTwits. Facebook reportedly plans on creating an app similar to Instagram for kids under the age of 13. Facebook shares were up 4% at $289.77 at last check. Facebook Short-Term Chart Analysis: The 5-minute chart above shows that Facebook stock has been building higher lows throughout the last two weeks. These lows can be connected with a trendline that shows possible future technical support. The stock may find short-term resistance near the high of the day near $292. The stock is trading above both the 200-day moving average (blue) as well as the volume-weighted average price (pink). This gives the stock a bullish short-term sentiment, and these indicators may hold as support in the near future. Facebook Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above on Facebook seems to be forming what technical traders call a “bullish flag” pattern. The bullish flag pattern occurs after the stock makes a bullish run and consolidates in a sideways channel before resistance is broken again and the stock makes its next leg up. Although “bullish” is in the name, the patterns may not follow what the name implies 100% of the time.

360b66a2-fce0-3096-81f4-43d16f094b20;FB;WhatsApp's New Privacy Policy Faces Indian Government's Backlash: Report;India’s federal government urged court restraint from Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB)-owned WhatsApp’s implementation of a controversial privacy policy, Bloomberg reports. India is the biggest market for WhatsApp by users. The government alleged that the app’s proposed policy violates India’s technology laws on various grounds. The lawyer previously appealed to the court challenging the new norms. Facebook already faced countrywide challenges over the launch of its payment service. The company has opposed the new guidelines that require it to break the encryption to identify illegal message originators on the platform. India’s technology ministry had previously expressed concern over the policy and requested for withdrawal of the changes. WhatsApp’s privacy policy failed to specify the nature of user data collection. It also did not guarantee confidentiality from third parties data access. WhatsApp and Facebook denied the collection and sharing of sensitive personal data. The government had previously criticized WhatsApp over differential treatment. The next case hearing is scheduled for April 28. WhatsApp had been sharing certain information with Facebook since 2016. Last year the company disclosed plans regarding user data sharing, including phone numbers and location with Facebook. WhatsApp asked users to share their consent for the new terms in January earlier this year which prompted immediate backlash, including threats of joining rival chat platforms like Signal and Telegram. Signal mobile apps had crossed 100 million monthly active users in February. As a result, WhatsApp offered three additional months to users for the review of its new policy. Price action: FB shares traded higher by 4.67% at $291.62 on the last check Friday.

d4de348c-b5ac-3b18-a150-325786061cc1;TSLA;Cathie Wood, Ark Funds Lay Out New $3,000 Price Target For Tesla Shares: What Investors Should Know;Ark Funds CEO and Co-Founder Cathie Wood joined Benzinga for the “Raz Report” interview earlier this month. At that time, Wood promised a new price target was coming on Tesla from Ark. On Friday, it arrived. Ark Funds on Tesla: Ark Funds updated its price target for shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) to $3,000 in the year 2025. Last year, Ark Funds listed a split adjusted price target on Tesla shares of $1,400 by the year 2024. Ark Funds uses a Monte Carlo model, based on a series of simulations to determine the probability of different outcomes with random variables. A total of 34 inputs and over 40,000 possible simulations were used to create the new price target. The bear case from Ark Funds is for shares of Tesla to hit $1,500 in 2025. The new bull case from Ark Funds is for Tesla shares to hit $4,000 in 2025. The price target from Ark Funds does not include Tesla’s energy storage or solar business in the models. The impact of the price of Bitcoin is also not included in the model from Ark Funds. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock Growth Ahead: Ark Funds said Tesla can sell between 5 million and 10 million vehicles in 2025 after new technology and production improvements. Tesla sold over 500,000 vehicles in 2020. The average sale price for Tesla’s electric vehicles was $50,000 in 2020. Ark calls for that figure to come in between $36,000 and $45,000 in the new price target model. For the first time, Ark Funds is including opportunities in insurance in its forecasting model. “Ark estimates that Tesla could achieve better than average margins on insurance thanks to the highly detailed driving data it collects from customer vehicles,” Ark says in the report. Tesla introduced its insurance product in 2019. It is currently only available in California. Ark believes in the next few years, Tesla could roll out insurance to other states, underwriting its own policies. Ark Funds updated its pricing model for Tesla to include assumptions on fully autonomous driving. Ark estimates the probability of delivering fully autonomous driving by 2025 at 50%. Ark previously listed a 30% chance by the year 2024.

She famously gave a split adjusted price target of $800 that was criticized by many on Wall Street. Her prediction came right earlier this year. Tesla is the largest holding in the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) with over 3.7 million shares worth $2.4 billion. Tesla is also the largest holding in the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE: ARKW) with 1.1 million shares held worth $752.5 million. Tesla represents 10.5% of assets in both ARKK and ARKW.

2e030321-35c8-3eaf-82d3-d1b895f21c4d;TSLA;Cathie Wood’s Ark Has a New Price Target for Tesla: $3,000;"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Management expects Tesla Inc. stock to hit $3,000 by 2025, up from its current price of $655. At that price, the company would be worth almost $3 trillion, based on the number of shares outstanding.Ark expects there’s a 50% chance of Tesla achieving fully autonomous driving within five years, which could allow the company to scale its planned robotaxi service quickly, according to a Friday note on Ark’s website.It also added Tesla’s insurance business into its model, believing the offering could be rolled out to more states in the next few years with better-than-average margins, thanks to “highly detailed driving data” the company collects.Wood has been among Tesla’s most ardent supporters, holding large stakes of the company in her flagship fund. When Tesla shares saw a pullback in February, she bought more.According to Ark’s new model, in the best case scenario, Tesla could reach $4,000 per share in 2025, and in the bear case, $1,500. The company forecasts Tesla’s unit sales to be between 5 million and 10 million vehicles in 2025, assuming increased capital efficiency.The $3,000 target is far higher than any analyst who covers the company, the highest being $1,200 among estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Fueled by zealous supporters, Tesla shares rose more than 740% last year, the best performance on the S&amp;P 500. Elon Musk, its chief executive officer, became the richest person in the world in January, before Jeff Bezos reclaimed the title.Not CloseAnalysts have speculated about the prospect that Tesla will launch a robotaxi service since at least 2015, but there’s little indication its technology is close to making this possible anytime soon. Tesla recently told California authorities that human drivers will still need to constantly supervise a new city streets function within its “full self-driving” suite of features sold as part of its Autopilot package.As for the company’s insurance product, that began in August 2019 and is currently available only in California. The company includes vehicle insurance revenue within its “services and other” category, along with after-sales service, sales of used vehicles and retail merchandise. Last year, all of that business combined was about 7% of total revenue.Ark’s model didn’t incorporate Tesla’s utility energy storage or solar business, nor did it consider future price fluctuations for Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings.Barron’s reported the price target earlier.(Updates with background throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.";Sat, 20 Mar 2021 19:01:06 +0000;TSLA_2021-03-20;0.9879;0.0

What Happened: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Saturday that his company would be ""shut down"" if its car were involved in spying, Reuters has reported. “There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information. ... If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down,"" he said by video link at the China Development Forum. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock This comes after Reuters and the Wall Street Journal separately reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Chinese officials have banned Tesla vehicles at military locations and sensitive state-owned companies, and possibly also at housing compunds where workers at sensitive locations live. This over concerns that cameras and data gathered in the vehicle could be used to leak national security information, including to the U.S. ""Whether it's Chinese or U.S., the negative effects if a commercial company did engage in spying — the negative effects for that company would be extremely bad,"" the Wall Street Journal quoted Musk as saying. ""Even if there was spying, what would the other country learn, and would it actually matter? If it doesn't matter, it's not worth thinking about that much."" Why It Matters: In February, Chinese officials raised concerns about safety issues with Tesla related to rapid acceleration and battery fires after it investigated two Tesla subsidiaries. Along with that, officials sought information from Tesla over how user data is taken out of the country. Nikkei Asia reported. The move comes amid newly increased tension between China and the U.S. Top Chinese and U.S. diplomats had a heated exchange on Thursday in Anchorage, Alaska, to kick off their first meeting since Joe Biden became U.S. president. China is the largest electric vehicle market in the world. Tesla sold almost 147,445 vehicles in China in 2020 — 30% of its total. Last year was the company's first profitable year in China. Price Action: Tesla's share price did not appear to suffer from news of the supposed Chinese ban, which came out early in the day on Friday in the U.S. Prices rose by 1.71, or 0.26%, to $654.87.

The past week's bullish calls included coffee, media and cybersecurity leaders. Electric vehicle, footwear and cable TV giants were among the bearish calls that were seen. It was another volatile week for the markets, which began near record highs but ended with the Dow Jones industrials, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all about 1% lower for the week. The Federal Reserve has taken a bullish stance, suggesting rates could remain unchanged until 2023. Yet, the wall of worry remained. Not only did Treasury yields concerns linger, but oil prices were falling, retail sales were disappointing, the specter of tax increases was on the table, and COVID-19 appeared to be flaring up again in Europe. In corporate news, the feud between two tech giants may be over, and another is making a huge investment in itself. The shift to electric vehicles continues, even as questions about their safety remain. Chip shortages are increasingly a problem for carmakers as well. Concerns have arisen over an approved COVID-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, an e-commerce giant announced that it will expand its health care footprint. Note that several states are suing the Biden administration over a canceled pipeline. And pent-up travel demand is beginning to show itself. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. Bulls Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is poised to benefit from strong growth in video streaming and a recovery in travel.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) is facing a setback in China, as the government has restricted certain state and military personnel from using the electric vehicle giant's vehicles, citing national security concerns. The Tesla Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a Neutral rating on Tesla with a $950 price target. The Tesla Takeaways: The ability of Tesla's sensors to record images of surrounding locations is consistent with the EV maker's footprint from a technological perspective, Ives said in a Friday note. The location monitoring and surveillance with Tesla's vehicles, the analyst said, sent fears up the chain in the Chinese government and military due to the fact that it is a U.S. company. Tesla finds itself in a unique position of being caught in the crossfire of tensions between the U.S. and China, he said. Related Link: Tesla Gets A Street High ,200 Price Target: 'The Fireworks Aren't Over Yet' This move is not a complete shocker, given Tesla's increasing market share within China and skyrocketing EV demand in this key region, Ives said, adding that it clearly indicates ""big brother is watching"" the situation closely. ""Tesla's massive Giga footprint remains a major strategic advantage vs. other EV players (domestic and foreign) as we believe Tesla has potential to be on a 300k run rate of demand in China by the second half of this year.""
